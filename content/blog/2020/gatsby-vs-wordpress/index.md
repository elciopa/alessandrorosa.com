Few weeks ago I discovered that Amazon gives an unlimited space on its [Amazon Photos] service for all Amazon Prime members. If you like photography and keep a backup of all your pics on this Amazon Drive follow these few lines where I'm gonna show what you need to do. The automation described is configured for a Synology NAS, but this could be easily triggered also on a QNAP or a Backup Server (easier with Linux but also on Windows can be done).

The interesting part is that there are no limitation for all photos formats: jpg, tiff,png, and even all image formats and all RAW formats (Canon, Nikon, Sony etc..). Personally I store more NEFs (Nikon's NEF) than JPEGs, so this sounded really good to me.

### How to configure it on a Synology DSM 6.x (also 5.x should be fine)

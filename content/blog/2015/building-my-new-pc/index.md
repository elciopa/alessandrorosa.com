Here my new pc. As every respectable nerd there have to be some overclocked stuff. Currently it runs smoothly and silently at 4.0 Ghz :). (Factory Frequency is 3.4 Ghz). The case, it's an air carbide 540 by Corsair and it's really big. It doesn't fit easily on my desk, but the airflow is really impressive. Any high cpu load can be cooled in few seconds, really impressive.

PC Specs:

- Case Corsair Carbide Air 540 Black
- Seasonic M12II-750 EVO
- MSI Z87-G45 Gaming
- Intel i5-4670K
- Sapphire Radeon R9 290 4Gb Tri-X OC Version
- Crucial Ballistix Tactical 16 GB DDR3 1866Mhz PC3-14900
- Samsung 840 Evo 250 GB + Samsung 850 Evo 500 GB
- 2 x Seagate Barracuda 14.2 2TB (Raid1)
- 2 x PB248Q LCD IPS Monitor
- Corsair Strafe RGB Mx Brown
- Logitech G305
- Corsair H90 (AIO Hydro Cooling System)
- NZXT White LED Sleeve

Just few words about why I prefer desktops. Usually I love to develop and work using VMs (Windows or Linux depending on what I'm working). Good VMs needs good hardware in order to run smoothly. That's why I cna't think about working on a laptop right now.
Furthermore, laptops once you put them under stress they tend to be really warm and fans starts screaming.
